			<h1 style="color:Magenta">Saturnia</h1>

			<p> Saturnia is the largest continent of the world and where most stories occur! It actually came first conceptually before the rest of Cosmotalia which largely exists because I wanted the ability to explore different places and genres. As the largest continent of the world, it has the widest variety of creatures, climates and cultures.</p>
			<p>It’s somewhat patchwork map is largely because the Sentinels, the main pantheon of Saturnia and who formed Saturnia into what it is today. Their magic influences Saturnia to this day, leading to some non-realistic features. This isn’t the only influence they have on Saturnia though! The vast majority of Saturnians (except for notable exceptions) are born with an Elemental alignment to one of the Sentinels with many believing this patron Sentinel was the one to create them.</p>
			<p>Saturnia itself has no central government, with many towns or regions having a governing system of their own. The closest thing the wider land has in the present day to this is the Saturnian Guardians, a set of creatures devoted to watching over the peace of Saturnia and organizing help when crises happen. The Conflagno Kingdom is a notable exception, both considering itself part of Saturnia the land yet not considering itself part of Saturnia the community. </p>
