		<h1>The Elements of Saturnia</h1>
			
		<p>The Thirteen Elements (plus one) is what dictates Saturnia’s magic system. The primary pantheon of the land, the <a href="/world/godsandspirits/sentinels">Sentinels of Saturnia</a>, affect the region’s magic, causing most creatures born there to be aligned under one of their Elements. Curiously, this system seems to extend to <a href="/world/critters/creatures/dragons">dragons</a> (even those born outside Saturnia), which originate from [[Dracana]] instead.</p>
		<p>Many Saturnians believe that, by being aligned under their patron’s Element, their soul is imbued by theirs or even is a very small piece of their patron’s soul.</p>
		<p>A creature’s alignment can inform their inborn ability, if they have one. For example, a Fire-aligned creature can conjure fireballs or a Mind-aligned creature can use telekinesis. Multiple abilities can also occur under multiple Elements, like storm summoning which can be dictated by Water, Lightning or Air. A creature’s alignment matching an enchanted item’s alignment may make them easier to learn to use as well.</p>
		<p>These abilities draw from a creature’s magical well and be used as often as there is magic available to use. Using a magic storage item, such as certain crystals, can lessen this draw or even reduce it entirely.</p>
		<p>The Thirteen Elements are as follows: Fire, Water, Earth, Air, Lightning, Ice, Nature, Mist, Light, Darkness, Sound, Metal, and Mind. </p>
		<p>While not technically an Element, the corrupted Element Ink operates by these same rules. Creatures aligned under it are rare, only including <a href="/world/critters/creatures/shapeshifters">shapeshifters</a>, creatures whose Element has been corrupted by external factors or certain anomalies.</p>
