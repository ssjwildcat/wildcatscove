      <h1>Magic</h1>

      <p>Magic is a naturally occurring phenomena all over Cosmotalia where it exists all throughout nature. Some believe its origin is godly in nature, like how Saturnia’s form of Elemental magic seems to come from the <a href="/world/godsandspirits/sentinels">Sentinels</a>, but how widespread it is instead suggests its a natural phenomena that the gods may affect. In fact, it seems to have a will all its own as magic can be massively affected by a user’s intention…</p>

      <h3>The Magical Well</h3>

      <p>Each creature has a magical well; an internal store of magic which is filled passively by magic within the environment. The size of magical wells vary naturally though a moderate average is common whereas abnormally large or small wells are rarer. Creatures that have a natural ability draw upon it to use their abilities. Rule of thumb dictates that less powerful abilities draw less magic and more powerful ones draw more. The drain on one’s magical well can be lessened by channeling items or outright circumvented with portable magical storage, such as certain gemstones and crystals.</p>
      <p>One should be concerned about the drain on their magical well because emptying it can lead to temporary fatigue, especially if the draw occurred particularly quickly. Overdrawing the magical well can have severe consequences and even leads to chronic ailments or a permanent damaging of the well or a creature’s magical abilities. Notably, a creature can lose their natural immunity to their aligned Element which can prevent them from using their inborn abilities again.</p>
      <p>All creatures’ magical wells are finite though tales tell of the [[13 Knights]] who have been gifted infinite wells from the Sentinels. Whether this is true or not isn’t clear…</p>

      <h3>Magical Corruption</h3>

      <p>As wondrous as magic is, it can be devastating and terrifying too. Magical corruption occurs when a high concentration of magic “infects” an area. This doesn’t naturally happen often, due to magic naturally “self-regulating”, but can happen if someone (or a group) willingly generates or gathers a large quantity of magic. This can cause a “whiplash” where the high magic concentrations rapidly collapses then explodse, causing massive amounts of damage.</p>
      <p>Specific effects vary wildly. Temporal, magical or spatial anomalies may occur. Local reality could be warped. Creatures could lose control of their magical abilities or have their magical wells damaged as it tries to absorb the highly concentrated magic. Flora, fauna and sapient creatures can be mutated or outright twisted into new monstrous forms, which might be the origin of <a href="/world/critters/monsters">monsters</a>. More minor effects can include confusion and illness. In more severe cases, creatures can exhibit personality changes. Curiously, magic seems to exaggerate the intent of objects when changed.</p>
      <p>Rarely, a creature can do this to themselves by overclocking their magical well. Obliviously, this is extremely dangerous and not advised.</p>
      <p>Magical corruption can be fixed, albeit slowly, by absorbing excess magic into storage objects and releasing it somewhere else. It will also fix itself over time as magic dissipates. </p>
