      <p>The land of Cosmotalia is host to a wide variety of gods and spirits, some more definitely real than others. After all, anything can become real if you believe hard enough.</p>
      
      <h3>Saturnia</h3>

      <h4><a href="/world/godsandspirits/sentinels">The Sentinels of Saturnia</a></h4>
      <p>Saturnia’s main pantheon. Made up of 13 Elemental gods who provide the Elemental magic of Saturnia and the alignments each Saturnian has. Largely benevolent but can be just as flawed as their creations.</p>

      <h4><a href="/world/godsandspirits/inketch">The Serpent of Balance and Inketch</a></h4>
      <p>The rival to the Sentinels. Once responsible for balance but now aligned with Ink, a corruption of the Balance element. Said to have been a malevolent force looking for overpower them but appearances can be deceiving...</p> 

      <h4><a href="/world/godsandspirits/oldspirits">Great Old Spirits</a></h4>
      <p>A collection of pre-mythic Saturnia spirits with esoteric abilities and no known origin. Many see honor and worship in everyday life.</p>

      <h4>The Draconic Pantheon</h4>
      <p>The main pantheon of Dracana and the dragons. Made up of 13 elemental gods and a central “leader” god. Oddly similar to the Sentinels.</p>

      <h4><a href="/world/godsandspirits/gemonympantheon">The Gemonym Pantheon</a></h4>
      <p>The massive and varied pantheon of the gemonyms, revered greatly in their everyday lives. Each god is represented by a concept and gemstone.</p>

      <h4>Cazcairn's Shattered God and its Shards</h4>
      <p>The ancient and mysterious central god of Cazcairn and the innumerable god-shards after it shattered mysteriously.</p>
