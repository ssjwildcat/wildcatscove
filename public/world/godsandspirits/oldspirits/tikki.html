      <center><h1>Tikki</h1>

      <h4>The Miraculous Mongoose, The Great Humbler, Grandest Trickster</h4></center>

      <p>Tikki is a trickster spirit and often called one of the Old Spirits. They are often said to be a prankster who delights in humbling others. In fact, it’s said their favorite targets are the prideful and smug. They don’t stay in one place long and are said to wander Saturnia, appearing as any other Saturnian.</p>

      <p>They are often depicted as a silver weasel with long tufted ears and a long tail, with black raccoon-like markings, brilliant green eyes and a purple belly. However, shapeshifting is part of their wide repertoire of abilities so they are often said to take different forms or even disguise themselves as others. They are characterized as silly and not serious, delighting in messing with others. They are also overconfident and cocky, which results in many stories in which they are humbled—however, it’s said they will never learn.</p>

      <p>Tikki features in many tales, often as the trickster duping others, including the other gods. A handful of comedic stories tell that sometimes they’re the one who gets duped. They also feature in many children’s folktales as well. Their most famous tale actually tells how they evaded the <a href="/world/godsandspirits/sentinels">Sentinels</a>, duping each one until they escaped into the population of their creations. It’s said that this is a sore spot for the Sentinels. It’s not exactly known what the full scope of their abilities is, as its often whatever is “convenient” but a handful include shapeshifting, mimicry and some form of reality warping.</p>
			
      <p>While Tikki isn’t seen as a specific patron to any group, there’s a handful of people who claim them as theirs: tricksters, comedians, jesters, rebels. There’s a handful of groups and cults that have sprung up in their name, swearing Tikki had visited them but who knows which tells the truth…</p>
