      <h1>The Great Old Spirits</h1>

      <p>The Great Old Spirits are a collection of Saturnian mythic age spirits, sometimes referred to as gods, only related to the fact their worship was prevalent during the time the <a href="/world/godsandspirits/sentinels">Sentinels</a> were active. Some believe the list recognized might not even be complete, as some might have been lost to time or had their origins obscured.</p>

      <p>Where exactly they came from varies wildly. Some say they were formed from “leftovers” when Cosmotalia was created. Others say they came into creation at the same time as Cosmotalia, from the same chaos that existed before it. Other theories include that they are merely anthromorphic manifestations of forces of nature or laws of reality or that they came from somewhere else entirely. Those that believe in an “All-Creator” believe they were made by them.</p>

      <p>Despite being grouped together, there is little they share. Each seems wholly unique with their own set of esoteric abilities. Their ability to create is debated though some species say they were made by one, like the <a href="/world/critters/creatures/flyingcats">flying cats</a> being made by Hachatte.</p>

      <p>Nowadays, worship of them is uncommon. Many Saturnians who honor the Sentinels believe they’re unworthy of the same rank as them, instead calling them “spirits” instead of gods. Still, many incorporate them into their worship, sometimes even alongside the Sentinels!</p>

      <h3>The Crusades against the Old Spirits</h3>

      <p>After the exile of the <a href="/world/godsandspirits/inketch">Serpent</a>, the Sentinels soon came into conflict with the spirits. Feeling threatened, the Sentinels often attacked the Spirits. Only <a href="/godsandspirits/sentinels/sapphidel">Sapphidel</a> didn’t agree, having felt guilt over their exile of the Serpent. She was soon joined by <a href="/world/godsandspirits/sentinels/jaquara">Jaquara</a>, who felt similarly guilty as their actions had introduced evil that might hurt her children. The pair convinced most of the Spirits to go into hiding though some either argued for their freedom successfully, disappeared or simply had been hibernating already.</p>
