      <center><h1>The Dreaming Viper</h1>
            
      <img src="/img/ref/dvref.jpg" alt="a purple-pink snake with a cloudy mane curled in a circle"></center>

      <p>Known by no other name but its title, the Dreaming Viper is an obscure and enigmatic deity. Few know of it and even fewer venerate it. They are thought to be a deity of dreams and the “in-between”. </p>

      <p>The Dreaming Viper is often depicted as a massive viper with large imposing horns, a wispy mane on his throat and tail and a curved tail blade. Its often depicted with a dawn color scheme but sometimes seen with one representing dusk, twilight or other liminal times. It’s said the Viper has been asleep for eternity and will remain so forever. It dreams as it sleeps and they say these dreams are peeks into other worlds. These dreams can open into the real world in “liminal spaces” where they say the veil between worlds is thin. As a result, odd occurrences are often blamed on the Viper and its dreams. </p>

      <p>What none know is the Dreaming Viper slumbers under Saturnia and the northern sea, the Viper Peaks being where its horns are exposed and the Unwanted Isle resting on its tail blade. As its been sleeping, it never had any encounter with the <a href="/world/godsandspirits/sentinels">Sentinels</a> or anyone at all, simply being a quiet influence on the lands it slumbers under. In fact, its the reason for many magical, spatial and other distortions at the Viper Peaks and Unwanted Isle. </p>
			
      <p>Few obscure cults worship the Viper, imbibing substances to cause visions and vivid dreams, believing its peeking into other worlds. Many of these cults also put a sacredness on lucid dreaming, saying it is actually the dreamer projecting themselves into other worlds or spaces.</p>
