      <center><h1>Zael</h1>

      <img src="/img/ref/zaelref.jpg" alt="a black and red bird with a long silver beak and forked tailS">

      <h4>Goddess of Death, Guardian of Lost Spirits, The Keeper of the Dead</h4></center>

      <p>Zael is an Old Spirit who presides over death and ferrying the souls of the dead to their afterlife. So important is this duty that its’s said the <a href="/world/godsandspirits/sentinels">Sentinels</a> respect her duty and let her carry on as a result. She is said to roost on the moon [[Mortemuna]] every day then take flight at sunset to gather the souls of the dead, bringing them to the afterlife by sunrise.</p>
			
      <p>She is commonly depicted as a large black and red avian with a long serrated hooked beak, hollow black eyes, and a stark white face. In her legends she is characterized as aloof but comforting to both the dead and living. She is also said to be dedicated to her job, even willing to face the Sentinels than to abandon it. She hates the cycle of life and death being broken, refusing to take mortals before their time and condemning those who try to cheat death.</p>

      <p>She is patron to those that work with the dead and its said to disrespect them is to disrespect her. She had a connection as a sort of patron to the mentally ill as some take her words that she ‘will not take before your time’ to heart. It’s even said there’s been some creatures who were visited by her before they attempted suicide.</p>

      <p>Zael is sister to <a href="/world/godsandspirits/oldspirits/aeln">Aeln</a> and born of the same feather”. They are often portrayed as allies though have come to blows before.</p>
           
      <p>Zael was one of the few Old Spirits to not gone into hibernation to escape the Sentinels. She is said to have stood up to them, calling their bluff, and was spoken for by <a href="/world/godsandspirits/sentinels/sapphidel">Sapphidel</a>. If she was to go dormant, souls would be stuck on Earth. So she was spared and given the role of “The Keeper of the Dead”. It’s even said the Sentinels couldn’t kill her if they wanted to, as she is older than anything else. It’s also said the last thing that will ever happen is Zael reaping the Sentinels at the end of time.</p>
