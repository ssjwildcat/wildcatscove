         <h4>Goddess of Birth, Guardian of New Spirits, The Keeper of Children</h4></center>

         <p>Aeln is an Old Spirit who presides over birth and is charge of bringing souls to the bodies of Saturnians. So important is this duty that its’s said the <a href="/world/godsandspirits/sentinels">Sentinels</a> respect her duty and let her carry on as a result. She is said to roost on the moon [[Vitae]] every night then take flight at sunrise to bring souls to new Saturnians, returning to the moon by sunset.</p>
			
         <p>She is commonly depicted as a grey-blue crane with a long beak and legs. In her legends, she is characterized as motherly and warm. She is also said to be dedicated to her job, even willing to face the Sentinels than to abandon it. While she is dedicated to keeping the balance of life and death, its known she has a soft spot for the young and sometimes intervenes when they are supposed to die. She is patron to mothers and those that work labor and delivery jobs and its said to disrespect them is to disrespect her. It’s said that if someone miraculously lives when they should have died, its because Aeln argued for them.</p>
              
         <p>Aeln is sister to <a href="/world/godsandspirits/oldspirits/zael">Zael</a> and “born of the same feather”. They are often portrayed as allies though have come to blows before.</p>
            
         <p>Aeln was one of the few Old Spirits to not gone into hibernation to escape the Sentinels. She is said to stood up to them and accounted the horrors that would happen if she was to hibernate, as souls would no longer inhabit newly born Saturnians and, as such, was spoken for by <a href="/world/godsandspirits/sentinels/sapphidel">Sapphidel</a>. So she was spared and given the role of “The Keeper of Children”. It’s said they couldn’t even kill her anyways, as her soul cannot be destroyed.</p>
