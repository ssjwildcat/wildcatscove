      <h1>The Gemonym Pantheon</h1>   
            
      <p>The <a href="/world/critters/creatures/gemonyms">gemonyms</a> have a massive and ever-growing pantheon that they feel a close connection to. Many of their stories feature these gods and how they affect their world.</p>

      <p>According to the gemonyms, in the beginning of the world, there was an empty expanse filled with nothing but magic. From this ambient magic, the chief of the pantheon, Diafi, was born.</p>

      <h5>Diafi</h5>
      <p><i>Diafi is the chief of the gemonym pantheon, represented by diamonds and considered the goddess of magic. Her diamond gemonyms are said to be favored and many folk heroes are diamond gemonyms. She’s thought to be dormant at the moment, having sacrificed herself to form the island of Brink, to protect her people from the harsh aboveground world.</i></p>

      <p>Shortly after Diafi formed, her presence stabilized the chaotic magicks of the void which separated into different forms, giving birth to the elemental deities of the gemonyms.</p>

      <h5>Rubine</h5>
      <p><i>Rubine is the goddess of fire and represented by rubies. She’s said to be domineering and short-tempered.</i></p>

      <h5>Jasp</h5>
      <p><i>Jasp is the god of earth and represented by jasper. He’s said to be carefree and down-to-earth.</i></p>

      <h5>Aquami</h5>
      <p><i>Aquami is the goddess of water and represented by aquamarine. She’s said to be cheerful, bubbly and a little ditzy.</i></p>

      <h5>Quarat</h5>
      <p><i>Quarat is the goddess of air and represented by quartz. She’s said to be whimsical and generous.</i></p>
			
      <h5>Saphir</h5>
      <p><i>Saphir is the goddess of storms and represented by sapphires. She’s said to be cool-headed and elegant.</i></p>

      <h5>Turqou</h5>
      <p><i>Turqou is the god of ice and the cold and is represented by turquoise. He’s said to be distant but wise.</i></p>

      <h5>Emeri</h5>
      <p><i>Emeri is the god of plants and represented by emeralds. He’s said to be kind and guiding.</i></p>

      <h5>Hemmate</h5>
      <p><i>Hemmate is the god of metal and is represented by hematite. He’s said to be hard-working and determined. He’s also the patron of blacksmiths.</i></p>

      <h5>Lapo</h5>
      <p><i>Lapo is the deity of light and is represented by opals. They’re said to be hyperactive and creative.</i></p>

      <h5>Obsid</h5>
      <p><i>Obsid is the deity of darkness and is represented by obsidian. They’re said to be broody and quiet.</i></p>

      <p>After the magic formed itself, the siblings sung the world into being and, as new concepts were created, so were their guardian gods.</p>

      <p>The first was the Celestial Trio, symbolizing the moons and sun.</p>

      <h5>Orthri</h5>
      <p><i>Othri is the goddess of birth and the moons and is represented by moonstones. Her twin is Othro and sister is Sunri. She is associated with the green moon Vitae which the gemonyms call by her name. She is said to be motherly and gentle. According to the stories, she carries all souls in her cradle before they are sent to their bodies. Ceremonies surrounding birth are done in her name.</i></p>

      <h5>Orthro</h5>
      <p><i>Othri is the goddess of death and the moons and is represented by moonstones. Her twin is Othri and sister is Sunri. She is associated with the dead moon Mortemuna which the gemonyms call by her name. She is said to be quiet and fierce. According to the stories, she ferries all souls after death to a paradise where they’ll live with Diafi forever. Funerals are done in her name where the deceased’s loved ones ask her to give their loved one safe passage.</i></p>

      <h5>Sunri</h5>
      <p><i>Sunri is the god of life and the sun and is represented by sunstones. His sisters are Orthri and Orthro. He is associated with the sun. It is said he defends the gemonyms from the outside world, crossing this space to put their souls in their bodies. In the rare occasion a gemonyms goes to the surface, they pray to him for safe passage. He is said to be courageous and brave.</i></p>

      <p>Next came the Nature Trio, a trio watching over the various aspects of the island Brink. It’s worth noting all three also symbolize disasters and are worshipped to prevent these disasters.</p>

      <h5>Pearlil</h5>
      <p><i>Pearlil is the goddess of the sea and represented by pearls. She is also associated with severe storms. It’s believed her eternal swaying creates the tides and that she must be revered lest her waves crash and flood their caverns. She’s said to be moody, like the sea, switching between calm or volatile at a moment notice.</i></p>

      <h5>Malachi</h5>
      <p><i>Malachi is the goddess of the land and represented by malachite. She is also associated with earthquakes. It’s believed she maintains the land and that she must be revered lest earthquakes bury their caverns. She’s said to be solid and mild-mannered but can randomly become unstable.</i></p>

      <h5>Kyan</h5>
      <p><i>Kyan is the goddess of the sky and represented by kyanite. She is also associated with windstorms. It’s believed she maintains the skies and, while her domain is less relevant to gemonyms, she is another deity they pray to when they must venture outside. It’s believed if she is not honored, she will use fierce winds to tear open the land and expose the caverns of Brink. She’s said to be calm but easily angered.</i></p>

      <p>After this, the world was formed but there was no life. So Diafi created the gemonyms, seeing other realms had been claimed by others. But instead of being discouraged, she gave her children all the gifts they needed to prosper in their home environment. To assist her, she also created 3 children, gifting the gemonyms with various qualities.</p>

      <h5>Xoyn</h5>
      <p><i>Xoyn is the deity of the body and represented by onyx. According to legend, they helped Diafi form the perfect shape for the gemonyms. They are said to be logical and calculating.</i></p>

      <h5>Ameth</h5>
      <p><i>Ameth is the deity of the mind and represented by amethyst. They gave the gemonyms sentience and the ability to reason. They are said to be enigmatic but kind.</i></p>

      <h5>Zapot</h5>
      <p><i>Zapot is the deity of the soul and represented by topaz. They helped form the souls of gemonyms. They are said to be reclusive but dedicated to their job.</i></p>

      <p>Another notable pair are Tigri and Blodstride, the two deities of conflict. When an unknown force from above came below slaughtering the gemonyms, these pair manifested; first to attempt to peacefully solve the conflict then to violently solve it in an event that is treated with grief.</p>

      <h5>Tigri</h5>
      <p><i>Tigri is the goddess of peaceful solutions and represented by tiger’s eye. She is considered the sister to Blodstride. She is characterized as stern yet patient, wanting to come to a solution that will benefit all parties without harm. It is to her gemonyms pray to for peaceful solutions and symbolic duels, negotiations and other acts to prevent violence are done in her name. She is said to carry the shed pacifism when gemonyms go into battle and return it afterwards which is literally interpreted in myths as her receiving Blodstride’s mantle before he enters combat and then laying it back over him afterwards.</i></p>

      <h5>Blodstride</h5>
      <p><i>Blodstride is the god of violent solutions and represented by bloodstone. He is considered the brother to Tigri. He is characterized as stoic but reliable, always answering the call to action. Some stories characterize Blodstride in a self-sacrificial way, implying Blodstride sees his duty as a necessary and traumatizing burden. He’s even said to go into a fugue state during combat, often forgetting what happened after the fact. It is to him gemonyms pray to prior to going into combat and who they believe walks with them during it. He’s often portrayed holding a large weapon which varies wildly as to what exactly it is and a large mantle he sheds before going into battle.</i></p>

      <p>After this, many other deities came into existence through various ways. Other more minor deities honored include:</p>

      <h5>Jaddet</h5>
      <p><i>Jaddet is the goddess of luck and represented by jade. She said to have manifested spontaneously though various tales have different, often outlandish, explanations. She is characterized as a trickster who truly means no harm but uses luck to change the outcomes of fate for little discernible reason—though they are largely considered generous in how she does so.</i></p>

      <h5>Prehni</h5>
      <p><i>Prehni is the deity of visions and prophecies and presented by prehnite. They are said to once been a normal gemonym, the first with a prehnite gem, who could speak to the pantheon directly. After their death, they ascended to the pantheon itself as a bridge between the mortal and immortal. Its said their favored are seers and messengers.</i></p>

      <h5>Citer</h5>
      <p><i>Citer is the deity of music and represented by citrines. They are said to be brash and loud.</i></p>

      <p>There’s many other deities and spirits honored in smaller numbers, often isolated to a single clan and often are considered the deity of a specific landmark, flora or other phenomena specific to that clan’s home. The number of these are way too numerous to identity and record.</p>
