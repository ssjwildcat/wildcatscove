      <section>
			
		<p>So you want to come into my sandbox and make an OC? I completely welcome the idea! This page should help you figure out what you’re doing!</p>
			
		<h4>What kind of animal should my character be?</h4>
			
		<p>There’s a wide variety of creatures throughout Cosmotalia! Creatures that exist in our world and creatures out of myth, fantasy and cryptozoology are on the table! For a slice of the more fantastical creature species: head on over to the <a href="/world/critters/creatures">Creatures</a> page! By rule of thumb, your animal should be small to medium but exceptions exist like <a href="/world/critters/creatures/dragons">dragons</a> or rocs. The vast majority of characters are going to be anthro, leaning towards a more naturalistic build.</p>
			
		<p>Some areas also have soft rules as to the kind of creatures that dwell there. These are soft rules though and can be used as guidelines/inspiration.</p>
			
		<ul>
		<li><b>Lucerna:</b> generally where you put your magitech, technologically modified creatures and fantasy robots</li>
		<li><b>Pheona:</b> animals with flight, gliding, climbing or jumping capability</li>
		<li><b>Brink:</b> homeland of gemonyms</li>
		<li><b>Heathbed/Pural:</b> forest animals are common</li>
		<li><b>Alis and Borau:</b> tundra/arctic/any cold locale animals</li>
		<li><b>Cazcairn:</b> desert animals are common</li>
		<li><b>Thauma:</b> mythical, fantastical or cryptozoological animals are common</li>
		<li><b>Satchu:</b> homeland of golden lemurs and Saturn Devils</li>
		<li><b>The Song Isles:</b> tropical animals are common</li>
		</ul>
			
		<h4>Where should my creature be from?</h4>
			
		<p>There’s a few things this will dictate, like the “genre” your creature belongs to and the magic system their abilities might come from. Here’s a cheat sheet for you:</p>
			
		<ul>
		<li><b>Saturnia:</b> general fantasy, magic system is the 13 Elements</li>
		<li><b>The Galaxy Archipelago:</b> general fantasy, for now general magic system</li>
		<li><b>Lucerna:</b> sci-fi fantasy, lots of magi-tech and modifications</li>
		<li><b>Pheona:</b> fantasy adventure, flight and the sky is a huge theme</li>
		<li><b>Brink:</b> fantasy, underground vs aboveground, general magic system</li>
		<li><b>Heathbed:</b> spiritual/natural fantasy, lots of connections to nature, general magic system</li>
		<li><b>Alis/Borau:</b> fantasy/survival, themes of cold, ice, mystery and survival</li>
		<li><b>Pural:</b> fantasy, lots of connections to natural, general magic system</li>
		<li><b>Ebonitz:</b> typically creatures from other places where they were fleeing crises or war</li>
		<li><b>Cazcairn:</b> western fantasy/weird west, big focus on magical items over magical abilities, magical abilities are mistrusted</li>
		<li><b>Thauma:</b> sword and sorcery fantasy, huge focus on magic with a general magic system</li>
		<li><b>Satchu:</b> dark fantasy, vague allusions to religion (don’t label it as Christianity but the vibes are there!)</li>
		<li><b>The Song Isles:</b> tropical fantasy, very chill and laidback region</li>
		<li><b>Pawwni:</b> Japanese-inspired for the time being</li>
      </ul>
			
		<h4>What kind of abilities should my OC have?</h4>
			
		<p>Generally? Anything you can think of!</p>
			
		<p>More specifically? Lean away from “catch-all” abilities, like broad manipulation of an Element. That is unless you making a [[Knight]].</p>
			
		<p>If making a Saturnian or dragon, figure out their ability or <a href="/world/magic/13elements">Element</a> then let that inform the other.</p>
			
		<h4>Do you have any examples or something I can use as inspiration?</h4>
			
		<p>Sure! Here’s my <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/penumbratiger/saturnia-insp/">Pinterest board</a>, <a href="https://toyhou.se/TheSaturnianWildcat/characters/folder:99472">Toyhou.se folder</a>, and <a href="https://toyhou.se/TheSaturnianWildcat/favorites/299337">other people’s Saturnia fan designs</a> for examples!</p>
			
		<h4>Anything else you think I should know?</h4>
			
		<p>If you’ve got any more questions, you can DM me on any of the sites listed <a href="/about/aboutme">here</a>!</p>
			
		<p>And if you end up making a character/AU/design, show me! I wanna see!</a>
			
		<p>Have fun!</p>
