      <section>
         <p>Welcome to the section dedicated to my headworld and paracosm of Cosmotalia (or Saturnia, as I often call it, since Saturnia the land came before Cosmotalia the planet)! If you like talking sparkleanimals, extremely soft fantasy and everything-but-the-kitchen-sink worldbuilding, you’re in the right place.</p>
         <p>Cosmotalia, or as it started Saturnia, is a fantasy world I’ve been cooking since I was 10 (so about since 2007)! It started out as a story called The Legend of Saturnia, which took inspiration from Narnia, Avatar the Last Airbender and a touch of Warrior Cats. It’s since evolved and mutated into something much different than what it started out while still retaining a lot of that childhood whimsy. </p>
         <p>Cosmotalia contains so much lore I probably haven’t even written it all down so this section is a perpetual work-in-progress.</p>
