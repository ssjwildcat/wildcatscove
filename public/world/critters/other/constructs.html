      <h2>Constructs</h2>

      <p>Constructs are artificially made creatures which are then animated by magic. They come in a wide variety of designs and materials, like rock, metal or clay. More advanced constructs are mostly found on [[Lucerna]] and are less common in [[Cazcairn]], [[Thauma]] and [[Pheona]]. Outside of those locations, constructs tend to be very simple and seen as more of a novelty than anything else. Very few are intended to be sentient or sapient beyond the basic logic they were animated with but very rarely the construct who seems to actually think and feel for themselves is found.</p>
