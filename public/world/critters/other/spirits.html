      <h2>Spirits</h2> 
            
      <p>There’s an array of spirits all over the world which seem to inhabit a space between the mortal plane and another. As a result, they don’t “live” in the traditional sense, not needing food, drink or sleep. Many have some connection to a god or greater spirit.</p>

      <div class="infocolumns">

      <p><b>Kitsune</b> are the many-tailed “watchfoxes” of Saturnia, created and appointed by the <a href="/world/godsandspirits/sentinels">Sentinels</a>. If you find one, they may grant you a wish—if you are pure of heart that is.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="infocolumns">
		<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/DZL9zk1Q/manekineko.png" alt="a bipedal cat with closed eyes and a lucky coin">
      <p><b>Manekineko</b> are one of the cat spirits of [[Hachatte]], the Mother of Cats. Appearing as a closed-eye cat holding a lucky coin, it’s said they bring luck to others.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="infocolumns">

      <p><b>Nekomata</b> are one of the cat spirits of Hachatte, the Mother of Cats. Appearing as a two-tailed cat, they are known to be mischievous and petty, causing all sort of misfortune for others.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="infocolumns">

      <p><b>Sprites</b> are small, glowing insect-like spirits which some say help the gods out. They are largely perceived as annoying and easily placated with sweets.</p>
