      <h2>Demons</h2>    

      <p>Demons are mysterious entities created by large scale tragic, sorrowful or traumatic events. There’s a misconception they are created of evil, most certainly colored by the circumstances of their birth.</p>
      <p>Their appearances vary wildly but often appear with traits of multiple creatures, monsters and beasts with implausible traits. Their appearances are influenced by the event that created them, like a flood giving its demon aquatic traits. The one trait all demons share is their sclera are black.</p>
      <p>All demons have magical abilities influenced by the event of their origin. To use our flood demon, this demon might have control over water or storms.</p>
      <p>All demons are also beholden by their nature to perpetuate the pain and sadness of the event that created them. As a result, they are often aggressive and violent beyond reason. Some guilds, such as [[GIEM]]’s demon-hunting subguild, are created solely to put down demons before they can cause much damage. However, it’s difficult but not impossible for a demon to break free of its nature. While it’s not entirely known how they do, as demons who do that remain elusive, some speculate that by mimicking the creatures around them and suppressing their violent nature, they may conquer their nature.</p>
