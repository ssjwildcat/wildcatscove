   <h2>Felisacans</h2>  
            
   <center><img src="/img/ref/felisacaninfo.png"></center>
            
   <p>Felisacans are bulky felines with lynx, lykoi and sabertooth features giving them furless faces, paws and bellies, tufted ears, bobbed tails and saber teeth. However the trait they’re most known for is their ability to transform into a larger, more bestial form at will. How exactly they can do this as the ability to transform is one rarely seen.</p>
   <p>Felisacans themselves are rarely seen as many Saturnians actually fear them for their transforming ability, perceiving them as restrained monsters. The largest community is found somewhere within the Hymnalaya Mountain range, in a hidden mountain they call the Secret Peak. Smaller communities and lone individuals live scattered all through Saturnia, often in isolated areas. </p>
   <p>When the first few felisacans mysteriously appeared, it led to a period of fear and hysteria which in turn lead to rumors like them being monsters in disguise or that their bite could turn you into something like them. In modern times, there is a lot less fear felt towards them but the felisacans do not forget easily. Some think they should try to come out of isolation but others fear that that would only ignite buried anxieties among their neighbors.</p>
   <p>Curiously, felisacans are born with a high rate of inborn abilities, something that hasn’t been explained.</p>
