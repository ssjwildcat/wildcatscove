   <h2>Ventarian Cats</h2>
   <h3>or Flying Cats or Winged Cats</h3>

   <p>Flying cats are more or less what it says on the tin; cats with wings. They tend to be a little bigger than a normal cat. What wings they can have include bird, bat, dragon, or insect wings. These wings are functional, most certainly using magic to actually fly. </p>
   <p>According to legend, the first flying cat was not made by any of the Sentinels but the Old One [[Hachatte]], the Mother of Cats. <a href="/world/godsandspirits/sentinels/sapphidel">Sapphidel</a> found her to warn her of their siblings wanting to harm her and in return with Hachatte going into hibernation, all she requested was Sapphidel watch over her various creations which the Sentinel promised to do. As a result, some flying cats honor both.</p>
   <p>Since their most striking feature is their wings, much of their culture revolves around that. Their courtships involve aerial dances. A kitten’s first flight is celebrated with food, dancing and gifts.</p>

   <h4>Flying Cat Bases</h4>

   <p>Due to their flight capability, they often settle in high areas, like in trees or on mountains. The most famous of these flying cat dwellings is the bases of Thunder’s Wing and Mentrix, both of which include buildings built on and around trees. These bases are used in the common days as schools, especially for flight, but in times of crises become valuable home bases between fights.</p>
   <p>Mentrix was the first of its kind, created back during the reign of the [[Elemental Monarchs]] and established to defend their kingdom of Sapphidel. Later, during the [[Saturnia-Dragon War]], more outposts of the style were constructed all over Saturnia and flying cats proved invaluable for their ability to meet the dragons in aerial combat. The newest, Thunder’s Wing, provided much help during the [[Ebony Wolf Crisis]].</p>
