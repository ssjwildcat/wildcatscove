        <h2>Dragons</h2>
            
        <p>Dragons are a widespread species that have spread across all of Cosmotalia, thanks to many being able to fly and the fact they can subsist on magic alone. Their true origin is the island of [[Dracana]] which is still home to many dragons today. Curiously, descendants of dragons who migrated to other continents trend smaller, as if they adapted to fit in.</p>
        <p>Dragons are truly omnivorous; while they can live perfectly fine off magic alone, they can eat and digest anything including meat, plants, rocks, gems and more. Their magical diet might be what allows so many to grow to large sizes and fly. </p>
        <p>Interestingly enough, dragons also are born aligned to an <a href="/world/magic/13elements">Element</a>, even if they weren’t born in [[Saturnia]]. While there is no solid explanation, some believe their main pantheon is related to the <a href="/world/godsandspirits/sentinels">Sentinels</a>, perhaps even being an aspect of them. Their Element always manifests into a breath weapon but can occasionally manifest into an additional ability.</p>
		<p>Speaking of their Elemental alignments, a dragon’s personal alignment is important to them. They refer to others aligned under the same Element as family, using the metaphor of being clutchmates with the draconic god of that Element being their parent. These feelings aren’t restricted to other dragons either!</p>
        <p>These clutches have their own names too:</p>

        <ul>
        <li><b>Fire:</b> Impnian (imp-nee-un)</li>    
        <li><b>Water:</b> Undarian (un-dar-ree-un)</li>  
        <li><b>Earth:</b> Terlian (tearl-lee-un)</li>  
        <li><b>Air:</b> Aerlian (aer-lee-un)</li>    
        <li><b>Lightning:</b> Tempestian (temp-pest-un)</li>

        <h3>Dragon Subspecies</h3>
        <br>

        <div class="infocolumns">
		<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Jz6sdw1P/dragon.png" alt="a four-legged winged dragon">
		<p><b>Drakes</b> are the most common subspecies of dragon. They have six limbs; four legs and a pair of wings. This means they often have a quadrupedal stance at large sizes but at smaller can go bipedal. They can have scales, fur or a combination of both.</p>
		</div>

        <div class="infocolumns">
		<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/ryxDFsLg/loong.png" alt="a four-legged Eastern dragon">
		<p><b>Loongs</b> are another common subspecies. They have four limbs; four legs and no wings. As with drakes, larger sizes can only be quadrapedal while smaller sizes can go bipedal. Their lack of wings doesn’t stop them from flying. Instead, they “swim” through magical currents in the air. They can have scales, fur or a combination of both. Many also have aquatic traits that allow them to breath underwater, even if not aligned under Water.</p>
		</div>

        <div class="infocolumns">
		<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/BZHjQbG7/wyrm.png" alt="a four-legged dragon with fins">
		<p><b>Wyrms</b>, like loong, have only four limbs and no wings. They instead are amphibious and usually do not fly at all. Some wyrms even live exclusively underwater and grow to massive sizes as a result. Thanks to their aquatic nature, they can breathe underwater, regardless of Elemental alignment. They usually have aquatic traits and scaled or smooth skin.</p>
		</div>

        <div class="infocolumns">
		<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/KcB1vjyN/lindwyrm.png" alt="a finned dragon with two arms">
		<p><b>Lindwyrms</b> are thought to be more related to wyrms than other dragons as they are similarly aquatically inclined. They have two limbs; a pair of arms. They cannot fly at all but are amphibious. Also similarly to wyrms, some live exclusively underwater and grow to massive sizes as a result. Thanks to their aquatic nature, they can breathe underwater, regardless of Elemental alignment. They usually have aquatic traits and scaled or smooth skin.</p>
		</div>

        <div class="infocolumns">
		<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/y6cDYxzQ/tatzelwyrm.png" alt="a furred cat-like dragons with two arms">
		<p><b>Tatzelwyrms</b> can be thought of as the terrestrial counterpart to lindwyrms as they also have only two limbs in the form of arms. They have some feline features on the face and sometimes have membranes attached to their arms that allow for gliding. While they can fly, swimming through magic currents like loong, they usually stick to gliding. Tatzelwyrms come in furred (sometimes called the arctic variant) and feathered (sometimes called the jungle variant) variants.</p>
		</div>

        <div class="infocolumns">
		<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/1Rw85XZY/wyvern.png" alt="a wyvern">
		<p><b>Wyverns</b> are another common subspecies, wyverns have four limbs; a pair of wings where arms would be and a pair of back legs. They are more commonly medium-sized. Like most dragons, use magic to facilitate flight as most do not have the wing size to do it under their own power. They can be scaled, feathered, furred or a combination of these.</p>
		</div>

        <div class="infocolumns">
		<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/FF3YszQS/beastdrake.png" alt="a stocky wingless dragon">
		<p><b>Beastdrakes</b>, like loong, have four legs and no wings. However while loongs tend to be long, beastdrakes trend stocky and bulky. Thanks to their build and lack of wings, they do not fly. They tend to be small to medium-sized. They can be scaled, furred or a combination of both.</p>		
		</div>

        <div class="infocolumns">
		<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/66n85qNG/amphithere.png" alt="a snake-like dragon with wings">
		<p><b>Amphitheres</b>  are long snake-like dragons with only a pair of wings. They can easily fly through the air but usually slither on land. They tend to be small and can be scaled, feathered or a combination of both.</p>
		</div>

        <div class="infocolumns">
		<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/3rmkJNHm/eraborn.png" alt="a bipedal gecko-like dragon with membranes attached to their arms">
		<p><b>Eraborn</b> are gecko-like dragons with four limbs; four legs and gliding membranes attached to their limbs. They are considered a sister species to the Gekkotae, thanks to their gecko-like appearances. While they can fly, many prefer to just glide. They tend to be small and are usually scaled.</p>
		</div>

        <div class="infocolumns">
		<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/9XZDF0jd/gekkotae.png" alt="a bipedal gecko-like dragon with wings on their back">
		<p><b>Gekkotae</b> are gecko-like dragons with six limbs; four legs and a pair of wings. They are considered a sister species to the Eraborn, thanks to their gecko-like appearances. They tend to be small and are usually scaled.</p>
		</div>

        <div class="infocolumns">
		<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/2jh18yf2/rattleviper.png" alt="a snake-like animal with a cobra hood, two arms and wings">
		<p><b>Rattlevipers</b> are a rare and elusive species of dragon. They are scaled and snake-like with arms, a pair of wings and venomous fangs. Some have hoods like a cobra. They can fly with their wings but don’t like to, saying that its too unwieldy with their body structure. They tend to be poorly tempered for reasons unknown. The largest population lives in isolation within the Glarewoods while others live within the Serpent’s Corridor.</p>
		</div>

        <div class="infocolumns">
		<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/NGmKfFwT/dracoraptor.png" alt="a winged Velociraptor">
		<p><b>Dracoraptors</b> are a rare species of dragon. They appear therapod-like with wings. They are typically medium-sized and can fly. Most have a combination of scales and feathers with feathery crests, arms and tails being common.</p>
		</div>

        <div class="infocolumns">
		<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/qByNMqdc/hydra.png" alt="a three-headed winged dragon">
		<p><b>Hydra</b> are an exceptionally rare species of dragon characterized by their multiple heads and sometimes, personalities. Their features vary wildly; they can have four to six limbs, a pair of wings or multiple pairs and, while typically scaled, can be feathered or furred or some combination of these. Their ability to fly relies entirely on the presence of wings. All hydras are massive, which makes their daily lives often difficult. While hydra can be born randomly to any species of dragon, some seem to manifest from magical explosions and whiplashes.</p>
