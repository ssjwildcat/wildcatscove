        <h1>About the Site</h1>
        <h2>or, a long winded tangent on why I made one to begin with</h2>

        <p>So everyone’s got a reason to make a website...what’s mine?</p>
        <p>Well, a couple. The first is simple: I needed a project. Without something new to engage me, I end up going a little stir-crazy then eventually depressed. I had been considering making one off-and-on for about a year before 2026 so it all ended up depending on when I decided to pull the trigger.</p>
        <p>The next reason is a tangent but it comes down to wanting a space I can host my art without feeling the pressure so many social medias demand of artists. Posting on Twitter, Tumblr, whatever else means you have to decide what tags you want, if you want to wait until an “optimal” time to post, what not to include in your post so it doesn’t lose reach—etc. It got so stressful that I’d forget to post my art then end up not posting at all. </p>
        <p>There’s really no large space on the Internet anymore for artists. Remember DeviantArt? I used to love DeviantArt until they released their Eclipse layout update (that no one wanted) which I personally found very overstimulating. Add on to their insistence on integrating and accepting generative AI along  with the fact their parent site is based in a certain country...I just can’t use the site anymore. </p>
        <p>Tumblr’s alright, with it’s chronological feed and tags to sort your art. Twitter, or rather X, is terrible because posts only gain traction for a few days at best then disappear into the void and that’s only the top of the iceberg. Instagram...well, I don’t like using a site that demands I format my art specially for it. There’s probably a dozen sites trying to be the next site for artists on the ‘net but there’s no telling how long they’ll last or how big a community they’ll attract.</p>
        <p>But here, I can build my own site with the layout I want with the features I want! And if people like it, they’ll find it and they’ll let me know. And if not, at least I had fun making it.</p>
